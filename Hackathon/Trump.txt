Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens and received an economics degree from the Wharton School. He was appointed president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded it from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, including licensing his name for real estate and consumer products. He managed the company until his 2017 inauguration. He co-authored several books, including The Art of the Deal. He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television show, from 2003 to 2015. Forbes estimates his net worth to be $3.1 billion.
Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. His campaign received extensive free media coverage. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Trump was elected president in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election despite having lost the popular vote.[b] His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Many of his comments and actionshave been perceived as racially charged or racist.
During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax cut package for individuals and businesses, which also rescinded the individual health insurance mandate and allowed oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge. He partially repealed the Dodd-Frank Act that had imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He has pursued his America First agenda in foreign policy, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imposed import tariffs on various goods, triggering a trade war with China, and negotiated with North Korea seeking denuclearization. He successfully nominated two justices to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
The Justice Department investigated links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government regarding its election interference. When Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, who was in charge of the investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to proceed with the probe. The investigation led to guilty pleas by five Trump associates to criminal charges including lying to investigators, campaign finance violations, and tax fraud. Trump repeatedly denied accusations of collusion and obstruction of justice, calling the investigation a politically motivated "witch hunt". Attorney General William Barr wrote that the special counsel's final report did not find that Trump or his campaign had "conspired or coordinated" with Russia during the 2016 election, and did not reach a conclusion regarding obstruction of justice, neither implicating him regarding obstruction of justice nor exonerating him.

Family and personal life
Early life and education
Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens, New York City.[1][2] His parents were Frederick Christ Trump, a real estate developer, and Mary Anne MacLeod.[3] Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[4][5] At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy,[6][7] a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[8][9] In 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University.[6][10] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[10][11] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump & Son.[12] He graduated in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.[10][13][14]

When Trump was in college from 1964 to 1968, he obtained four student draft deferments.[15][16] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination and in July 1968, a local draft board briefly classified him as eligible to serve. In October 1968, he was given a medical deferment that he later attributed to spurs in the heels of both feet, which resulted in a 1-Y classification: "Unqualified for duty except in the case of a national emergency."[17] In the December 1969 draft lottery, Trump's birthday, June 14, received a high number that would have given him a low probability to be called to military service even without the 1-Y.[17][18][19] In 1972, he was reclassified as 4-F, which permanently disqualified him from service.[18][20]
In 1973 and 1976, The New York Times reported that Trump had graduated first in his class at Wharton. However, a 1984 Times profile of Trump noted that he had never made the honor roll. In 1988, New York magazine reported Trump conceding, "Okay, maybe not 'first,' as myth has it, but he had 'the highest grades possible.'"[21] Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, testified to the House Oversight Committee in February 2019 that Trump "directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores."[22] Days after Trump stated in 2011, "I heard [Barack Obama] was a terrible student, terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?...Let him show his records,"[23] the headmaster of Trump's alma mater, New York Military Academy, was instructed by his manager to secure Trump's academic records so they could not be released, reportedly at the direction of "prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump's friends".[24]
Ancestry and parents
Further information: Trump family
Trump's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt in the Palatinate on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides in Scotland on his mother's side. All of his grandparents and his mother were born in Europe.[25]
Trump's paternal grandfather, Frederick Trump, first immigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16 and became a citizen in 1892.[26] He amassed a fortune operating boomtown restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during its gold rush.[26] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple permanently settled in New York in 1905.[27] Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.[28]
Trump's father Fred was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father's death. Their company, "E. Trump & Son",[c] founded in 1923,[33] was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments.[28][34] In spite of his German ancestry, "Fred Trump sought to pass himself off as Swedish amid anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II."[35] Donald Trump "reaffirmed the myth" in The Art of the Deal.[35][36][37]
Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she immigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[38] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[38][39]
Wives, siblings, and descendants
Main article: Family of Donald Trump
Trump grew up with three elder siblings—Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth—as well as a younger brother named Robert. Maryanne is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[40]
Trump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[41][42] In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková, at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[43][44] They had three children: Donald Jr. (b. 1977), Ivanka (b. 1981), and Eric (b. 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[45] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[46] In October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump's daughter, who was named Tiffany in honor of high-end retailer Tiffany & Company.[47] Maples and Trump were married two months later in December 1993.[48] They divorced in 1999,[49] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[50]


Trump is sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Roberts on January 20, 2017: Trump, his wife Melania, and his children Donald Jr., Barron, Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany
In 1998,Trump met Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[51] She became his third wife when they married in 2005 at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida.[52] In 2006, she gained United States citizenship[53] and gave birth to a son, Barron.[54][55] Melania became First Lady when Trump took office as president in January 2017.[56]
Upon his inauguration, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[57] His daughter Ivanka resigned from the Trump Organization and moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[58]and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[59]
Religion
Trump is a Presbyterian.[60][61][62] His ancestors were Lutheran on his paternal grandfather's side in Germany[63] and Presbyterian on his mother's side in Scotland.[64] His parents married in a Presbyterian church in Manhattan in 1936.[65] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where he had his confirmation.[44] In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan,[66] part of the Reformed Church.[67]The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale, ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[68][66] In August 2015 Trump told reporters, "I am Presbyterian Protestant. I go to Marble Collegiate Church," adding that he attends many different churches because he travels a lot.[69] The Marble Collegiate Church then issued a statement noting that Trump and his family have a "longstanding history" with the church, but that he "is not an active member".[67]
Trump said he was "not sure" whether he ever asked God for forgiveness, stating "If I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture." He said he tries to take Holy Communion as often as possible because it makes him "feel cleansed".[60] While campaigning, Trump referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, "Nothing beats the Bible."[70] The New York Times reported that evangelical Christians nationwide thought "that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure."[71]
Trump has associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his "closest spiritual confidant."[72] In 2015, he released a list of religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, Michele Bachmann, Robert Jeffress, and others.[73][74]
Health
Main article: Health of Donald Trump
Trump does not drink alcohol, a reaction to his older brother Fred Trump Jr.'s alcoholism and early death.[75][76] He has stated that he has never smoked cigarettes or used drugs, including marijuana.[77] In December 2015, Trump's personal physician, Harold Bornstein, released a superlative-laden letter of health, which stated that Trump's "physical strength and stamina are extraordinary."[78][79] Bornstein later said that Trump himself had dictated the contents of the letter.[80] A follow-up medical report showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin.[81][82] In January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician Ronny Jackson, who stated that he was in excellent health and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues,[83] although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended.[84] Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle, and LDL cholesterol level ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health.[85] In February 2019, Trump underwent another physical examination; White House physician Sean Conley said Trump was in "very good health overall", although Trump had gained weight and was now clinically obese.[86]
Wealth
Main article: Wealth of Donald Trump
See also: Tax returns of Donald Trump
In 1982, Trump was listed on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals as having a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth. His financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from the list between 1990 and 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993.[87] In its 2019 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.1 billion[a] (715th in the world, 259th in the U.S.)[90] making him one of the richest politicians in American history and the first billionaire American president.[90] During the three years since Trump announced his presidential run in 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth declined 31% and his ranking fell 138 spots.[91] When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10 billion;[92] however FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth over $50 million, yielding total assets worth more than $1.4 billion and debt over $265 million.[93] Trump reported hundreds of millions of dollars of yearly income from 2014 to 2018.[92][94][95] Trump stated in a 2007 deposition, "My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings."[96]
Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported in April 2018 that Trump, using a pseudonym "John Barron," called him in 1984 to falsely assert he then owned "in excess of 90 percent" of the Trump family's business in an effort to secure a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans.[97]
Trump has often said that he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.[98] In October 2018, The New York Timesreported that Trump "was a millionaire by age 8", borrowed at least $60 million from his father, and largely failed to reimburse him, and had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime.[99][100] According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied; the tax department of New York says it is "vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation" into it.[101][102] Analyses by The Economist and The Washington Post have concluded that Trump's investments have under-performed the stock market.[103][104] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that the value of Trump's personal brand licensing business had declined by 88% since 2015, to $3 million.[105]

Real estate


The distinctive façade of Trump Tower, the headquarters of The Trump Organization, in Midtown Manhattan
In 1968, Trump began his career at his father Fred's real estate development company, E. Trump & Son, which, among other interests, owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[106][107] Trump worked for his father to revitalize the Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, which the elder Trump had bought in 1964.[108][109] The management of the property was sued for racial discrimination in 1969; the suit "was quietly settled at Fred Trump's direction."[109] The Trumps sold the property in 1972, with vacancy on the rise.[109]
When his father became chairman of the board in 1971, Trump was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[110][111] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended in a lawsuit that their company systematically discriminated against African Americans who wished to rent apartments. The Department alleged that the Trump Organization had screened out people based on race and not low income as the Trumps had stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[112][113] Trump's attorney at the time was Roy Cohn, who valued both positive and negative publicity, and responded to attacks with forceful counterattacks; Trump later emulated Cohn's style.[114]
Manhattan developments
In 1978, Trump launched his Manhattan real estate business by purchasing a 50 percent stake in the derelict Commodore Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal. The purchase was funded largely by a $70 million construction loan that was guaranteed jointly by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain.[115][116] When the remodeling was finished, the hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel.[117]
The same year, Trump obtained the rights to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 664-foot-high (202 m) mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[118][119] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation.[120] The building was completed in 1983 and houses Trump's primary penthouse condominium residence and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[121][122] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find that the tower's atrium was "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years".[123][124]


Wollman Rink in Central Park after the Trump renovation
A general contractor unconnected to Trump started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park in 1980. The project had an expected 2
 
1⁄2-year construction schedule but was not completed by 1986. Trump took over the project and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget. He then operated the rink for one year with some profits going to charity in exchange for the rink's concessionrights.[125][126][127] According to journalist Joyce Purnick, Trump's "Wollman success was also the stuff of a carefully crafted, self-promotional legend."[128]
In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million and appointed his wife Ivana to manage its operation.[129] Trump invested $50 million to restore the building, which he called "the Mona Lisa".[130] According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking. They sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved in the hotel's day-to-day operations.[131]
In 1994, Trump's company refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle with design and structural enhancements, turning it into a 44-story luxury residential and hotel property[132][133] known as Trump International Hotel and Tower.[134]
In 1996, Trump acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street.[135] In 1997, he began construction on Riverside South, which he dubbed Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. He and the other investors in the project ultimately sold their interest for $1.8 billion in 2005 in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[136] From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50 percent share of the Empire State Building. He intended to rename it "Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments" if he had been able to boost his share.[137][138] In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower.[139] In 2002, Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue; the building consisted of 35 stories of luxury condominiums.[140]
Palm Beach estate
Main article: Mar-a-Lago


Mar-a-Lago in 2009
In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for $10 million, $7 million for the real estate and $3 million for the furnishings.[141][142] His initial offer of $28 million had been rejected, and he was able to obtain the property for the lower price after a real-estate market "slump".[143] The home was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post.[144] After her death, her heirs unsuccessfully tried to donate the property to the government before putting it up for sale.[144][145] In addition to using a wing of the estate as a home, Trump turned Mar-a-Lago into a private club. In order to join, prospective members had to pay an initiation fee[146] and annual dues.[147] The initiation fee was $100,000 until 2016; it was doubled to $200,000 in January 2017.[148][149]
Atlantic City casinos
After New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, Trump traveled to Atlantic City to explore new business opportunities. Seven years later, he opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino; the project was built by Trump with financing from the Holiday Corporation, who also managed its operation.[150]It was renamed "Trump Plaza" soon after it opened.[151] The casino's poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corporation, which led to Trump paying $70 million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[152][153] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump's wife Ivana managed the property until 1988.[154][155]


Entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City
Trump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal, in 1988 while it was under construction, through a complex transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International.[156] It was completed at a cost of $1.1 billion and opened in April 1990.[157][158] The project was financed with $675 million in junk bonds[159] and was a major gamble by Trump.[160] The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[161] leaving Trump with 50 percent ownership.[162] Facing "enormous debt", he gave up control of his money-losing airline, Trump Shuttle, and sold his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[163][164][165]
In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[166] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[167] Trump remained chairman of THCR until 2009.[168]
Golf courses
Main article: Donald Trump and golf


Turnberry Hotel and golf course in Ayrshire, Scotland
As of December 2016, the Trump Organization owns or operates 18 golf course and golf resorts in the United States and abroad.[169] According to Trump's FEC personal financial disclosure, his 2015 golf and resort revenue amounted to $382 million,[170][94] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[171]
Trump began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999; his first property was the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in Florida.[172] By 2007, he owned four courses around the U.S.[172] Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, he began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them.[173] His use of these courses during his presidency was controversial. Despite frequently criticizing his predecessor Barack Obama for his numerous golf outings, Trump golfed 11 times during his first eight weeks in office.[174] According to CNN, Trump visited Trump-owned golf courses 91 times in 2017, although the White House does not disclose whether or not the president actually played on each of those visits.[175]
Branding and licensing
See also: List of things named after Donald Trump


Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago
The Trump Organization expanded its business into branding and management by licensing the Trump name for a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint beyond New York with the branding and management of various developers' hotel towers around the world. These included projects in Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. There are also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai, and Indonesia.[176]
The Trump name has also been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings. In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.[177] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least $59 million in yearly revenue for his companies.[178] The Post reported in April 2018 that — of the 19 consumer goods companies Trump said in 2015 were licensing his name — only two continue to do so, in Panama and Turkey.[179]
Lawsuits and bankruptcies
Main article: Legal affairs of Donald Trump
As of April 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by USA Today.[180] As of 2016, he or one of his companies had been the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[181][182]
Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, although in 1990 he came within one missed bank loan payment of doing so, agreeing to a deal that temporarily ceded management control of his company to his banks and put him on a spending allowance.[183] Trump claimed to have initiated this deal with his banks as he saw the downturn in the real estate market, but bankers involved in the matter stated they initiated the negotiations before Trump had realized there was a problem.[184] His hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[185][186] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, "I do play with the bankruptcy laws – they're very good for me" as a tool for trimming debt.[187][188] The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[189][190]
During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion,[184] but in the aftermath of his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks declined to lend to him, with a notable exception of Deutsche Bank.[191]
Side ventures
After Trump took over the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he expanded its real estate operations and ventured into other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[192]
Sports
In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals—an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL). After the 1985 season, the league folded largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule where they competed with the NFL for audience, and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the organization.[193][194]
Trump operated golf courses in several countries.[193] He hosted several boxing matches at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, including Mike Tyson's 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[195] He also acted as a financial advisor to Mike Tyson.[196] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[197]
Trump Shuttle
Main article: Trump Shuttle
In 1988, Trump bought the Air-Shuttle, including 21 planes and landing rights at three airports in New York City, Boston, and the Washington, D.C., area, from Eastern Airlines which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He financed the purchase price of $380 million through 22 banks. The airline operated as the Trump Shuttle from 1989 to 1992, offering charter services in addition to scheduled shuttle flights. It lost money from the start, and its control reverted to the banks in mid-1990. It was sold to USAir Group in 1992.[198][199][200][201]
During the first Gulf War the U.S. government contracted with Trump Shuttle to carry Armed Forces personnel between locations in the U.S., which may have led to the erroneous claim by a former Marine at a Trump campaign rally that Trump had dispatched his personal jet to transport a group of Marines from North Carolina to Florida. The falsehood was publicized on Hannity and confirmed by the Trump campaign.[200][202]
Miss Universe


Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, installed in 2007
From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants.[203][204] The pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. His management of this business involved his family members—daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA.[205] He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[206][207] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[208]
Following Trump's controversial statements about illegal Mexican immigrants during his 2015 presidential campaign kickoff speech, NBC ended its business relationship with him, stating that it would no longer air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageants on its networks.[209] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization and then sold the entire company to the WME/IMG talent agency.[210]
Trump University
Main article: Trump University
Trump University was a for-profit education company that was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny. The company ran a real estate training program and charged between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[211][212][213] In 2005, New York State authorities notified the operation that its use of the word "university" was misleading and violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the "Trump Entrepreneurial Institute".[214] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[215]
Ronald Schnackenberg, a sales manager for Trump University, said in a testimony that he was reprimanded for not trying harder to sell a $35,000 real estate class to a couple who could not afford it.[216] Schnackenberg said that he believed "Trump University was a fraudulent scheme" which "preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money."[216]
In 2013, New York State filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University; the suit alleged that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[214][217] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[218] During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized presiding Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, alleging bias in his rulings because of his Mexican heritage.[219][220] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases, whereby Trump paid a total of $25 million and denied any wrongdoing.[221][222]
Foundation
Main article: Donald J. Trump Foundation
The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[223] that was established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal.[224][225] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[226] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[226]
The foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[227] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York–Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[228][229] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[226]
In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[230] Also in 2016, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities, ordering it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[231][232][233] A Trump spokesman called the Attorney General's investigation a "partisan hit job".[231] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove "even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President."[234] According to an IRS filing in November 2017, the foundation intended to shut down and distribute its assets (about $970,000) to other charities. However, the New York Attorney General's office had to complete their ongoing investigation before the foundation could legally shut down,[235] and in June 2018 they filed a civil suit against the foundation for $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[236] The suit names Trump himself as well as his adult children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka.[237]
Conflicts of interest
Before being inaugurated as president, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his eldest sons and a business associate.[238][239] According to ethics experts, as long as Trump continues to profit from his businesses, the measures taken by Trump do not help to avoid conflicts of interest.[240] Because Trump would have knowledge of how his administration's policies would affect his businesses, ethics experts recommend that Trump sell off his businesses.[239] While Trump has said that his organization would eschew "new foreign deals", the Trump Organization has since pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[240] Multiple lawsuits have been filed alleging that Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the United States Constitution, which forbids presidents from taking money from foreign governments, due to his business interests; they argue that these interests allow foreign governments to influence him.[240][241] Previous presidents in the modern era have either divested their holdings or put them in blind trusts,[238] and he is the first president to be sued over the emoluments clause.[241] A suit, D.C. and Maryland v. Trump, brought in June 2017 by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, cleared three judicial hurdles to proceed to the discoveryphase during 2018,[242][243][244] with prosecutors issuing 38 subpoenas to Trump's businesses and cabinet departments in December before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay days later at the behest of the Justice Department, pending hearings in March 2019.[245][246][247]
Media career
Books
Main article: Bibliography of Donald Trump
Trump has published numerous books. His first published book in 1987 was Trump: The Art of the Deal, in which Trump is credited as co-author with Tony Schwartz, who has stated that he did all the writing for the book.[248][249][250] It reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, stayed there for 13 weeks, and altogether held a position on the list for 48 weeks.[249] According to The New Yorker, "The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon."[249] Trump's published writings shifted post-2000 from stylized memoirs to financial tips and political opinion.[251]
Film and television
Professional wrestling
In 1988 and 1989, Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.[252][253] Trump headlined WrestleMania 23 in 2007 and a Monday Night Raw in 2009;[253] the catchphrase "You're fired" he used on The Apprentice was also used by WWE owner Vince McMahon.[253] In 2013, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame during WrestleMania 29.[254]
In July 2017, Trump posted an altered video clip with the hashtag "FraudNewsCnn" to his personal twitter account. The clip, which was retweeted by the official @POTUS twitter account, showed a Wrestlemania 23 move of Trump seeming to knock McMahon to the ground and punch him; in the edited version, a CNN logo is superimposed on McMahon's head.[255][256][257][258] Following months of Trump attacking the media and particularly CNN as fake news and enemies of the people, the tweet was widely critized as appearing to incite violence against journalists.[255][256][257][259]
The Apprentice
In 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a one-year management job with the Trump Organization; applicants were successively eliminated from the game with the catchphrase "You're fired".[260][248][261] He went on to be co-host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities.[260][261][262]
In February 2015, Trump stated that he was "not ready" to sign on for another season of the show because of the possibility of a presidential run.[263] Despite this, NBC announced they were going ahead with production of a 15th season.[264] In June, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, "Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump."[265]
Acting
Main article: Donald Trump filmography
Trump has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series,[266] including as the father of one of the characters in The Little Rascals.[267][268] He performed a song with Megan Mullally at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2005.[269][270]
Trump receives a pension as a member of the Screen Actors Guild.[271] His financial disclosure forms mentioned an annual pension of $110,000 in 2016 and $85,000 in 2017.[271][272][273]
Radio and television commentary
Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show on talk radio.[274] Trump also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped!(one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.[275][276][277] In 2011, Trump was given a weekly unpaid guest commentator spot on Fox & Friends that continued until he started his presidential candidacy in 2015.[278][279][280][281]
Public profile
Approval ratings
Further information: Opinion polling on the Donald Trump administration
Presidential approval polls taken during the first ten months of Trump's term have shown him to be the least popular U.S. president in the history of modern opinion polls.[282][283][284] A Pew Research Center global poll conducted in July 2017, found "a median of just 22 percent has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs". This compares to a median of 64 percent rate of confidence for his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump received a higher rating in only two countries: Russia and Israel.[285] An August 2017 POLITICO/Morning consult poll found on some measures "that majorities of voters have low opinions of his character and competence".[286] By December 2018, Trump's approval ratings, averaged over many polls, stood at roughly 42%, two points below Obama's 44% at the same time in his presidency, and one point above Ronald Reagan.[287] Trump's two-year average Gallup approval rating was the lowest of any president since World War II.[288]
Trump is the only elected president who did not place first on Gallup's poll of Americans' most admired men in his first year in office, coming in second behind Obama.[289][290] The Gallup poll near the end of Trump's second year in office named him the second most admired man in America – behind Obama – for the fourth consecutive year.[291][290]
False statements
Main article: Veracity of statements by Donald Trump
As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[292][293][294] The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics.[295][296][297] His falsehoods have also become a distinctive part of his political identity.[296]
Trump uttered "at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days" in office according to The New York Times,[292] and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the "Fact Checker" political analysis column of The Washington Post.[298] By Trump's 773rd day in office, the Post's tally stood at 9,014 false or misleading claims.[299] For the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections, it rose to an average of 30 per day[300] from 4.9 during his first 100 days in office.[301] The Post found that Trump averaged 15 false statements per day during 2018.[302]
Racial views
Main article: Racial views of Donald Trump
Trump has a history of making racially controversial remarks and taking actions that are perceived as racially motivated.[303] In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[107][304][305] He was accused of racism for insisting that a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger attack, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. He continued to maintain this position as late as 2016.[306]
Starting in 2011, Trump was a major proponent of "birther" conspiracy theories alleging that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and questioned his eligibility to serve as president.[307][308] Trump later took credit for pushing the White House to release the "long-form" birth certificate from Hawaii,[309][310][311] and he stated during his presidential campaign that his stance had made him "very popular".[312] In September 2016, he publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States, and falsely asserted that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton and her 2008 presidential campaign.[313]



Trump makes a statement (begins at 7:20 into the video) on the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville published by the White House
According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made "explicitly racist appeals to whites" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[314] Trump launched his campaign with a speech in which he stated: "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. ... They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people."[315][316][317][318] Later, his attacks on a Mexican-American judge were criticized as racist.[319] His comments following a 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, were seen as implying a moral equivalence between the white supremacist marchers and those who protested them.[320] In a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation with Congressional leaders, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African countries as "shitholes".[321] His remarks were condemned as racist worldwide, as well as by many members of Congress.[322][323][324] Trump has denied accusations of racism multiple times, saying he is the "least racist person".[325][326]
Trump's racially insensitive statements and actions[304] have been condemned by many observers in the U.S. and around the world,[327][328] but accepted by his supporters either as a rejection of political correctness[329][330] or because they harbor similar racial sentiments.[331][332] Several studies and surveys have stated that racist attitudes and racial resentment have fueled Trump's political ascendance, and have become more significant than economic factors in determining party allegiance of voters.[332][333] In a June 2018 Quinnipiac University poll, 49 percent of respondents believed that Trump is racist while 47 percent believed he is not. Additionally, 55 percent said he "has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly."[334][335]
Relationship with the press


Trump talking to the press, March 2017
Further information: Presidency of Donald Trump § Relationship with the media
Throughout his career, Trump has sought media attention. His interactions with the press turned into what some sources called a "love-hate" relationship.[336][337][338] Trump began promoting himself in the press in the 1970s.[339]
Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency, Trump has repeatedly accused the press of intentionally misinterpreting his words and of being biased, calling them "fake news media" and "the enemy of the people".[340][341] In the campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[342] After winning the election, Trump told journalist Lesley Stahl that he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media "so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you".[343] Into his presidency, Trump has described negative media coverage as "fake news".[344][345] Trump has privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' White House press credentials (despite, during his campaign, promising not to do so once he became president).[346]
A study found that between October 7 and November 14, 2016, while one in four Americans visited a fake news website, "Trump supporters visited the most fake news websites, which were overwhelmingly pro-Trump" and "almost 6 in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10 percent of people with the most conservative online information diets".[347][348] Brendan Nyhan, one of the authors of the study, stated in an interview on NBC News: "People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites".[349]
Popular culture
Main articles: Donald Trump in popular culture and Donald Trump in music
Trump has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode "Bart to the Future", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017 on Comedy Central, while another one called Our Cartoon President debuted on Showtime in February 2018.[350]
Trump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of hip hop lyrics since the 1980s, as he was named in hundreds of songs, most often in a positive tone.[351][352] Mentions of Trump turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015.[351][353][354]
Social media
Main article: Donald Trump on social media
Trump's presence on social media has attracted attention worldwide since he joined Twitter in March 2009. He communicated heavily on Twitter during the 2016 election campaign, and has continued to use this channel during his presidency. The attention on Trump's Twitter activity has significantly increased since he was sworn in as president. He uses Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press.[355] Many of the assertions he tweeted have been proven false.[356][357][358]
Recognition
Further information: List of honors and awards received by Donald Trump
In 2015, Robert Gordon University revoked the honorary Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) it had granted Trump in 2010, stating that "Mr. Trump has made a number of statements that are wholly incompatible with the ethos and values of the university."[359] In December 2016, Time named Trump as its "Person of the Year".[360] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the "award", but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the "President of the Divided States of America."[361][362] In the same month, he was named Financial TimesPerson of the Year[363] and was ranked the second most powerful person in the world after Vladimir Putin, by Forbes.[364]
Political career
Political activities up to 2015
Trump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. He registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987,[365] switched to the Reform Party in 1999, the Democratic Party in 2001, and back to the Republican Party in 2009.[365] He made donations to both the Democratic and the Republican party, party committees, and candidates until 2010 when he stopped donating to Democrats and increased his donations to Republicans considerably.[366]
In 1987 Trump spent $94,801 (equivalent to $209,068 in 2018) to place full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, proclaiming that "America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves."[367] The advertisements also advocated for "reducing the budget deficit, working for peace in Central America, and speeding up nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union."[368] After rumors of a presidential run, Trump was invited by then U.S. Senator John Kerry (Democrat from Massachusetts), House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, and Arkansas congressman Beryl Anthony Jr., to host a fundraising dinner for Democratic Congressional candidates and to switch parties. Anthony told The New York Times that "the message Trump has been preaching is a Democratic message." Asked whether the rumors were true, Trump denied being a candidate, but said, "I believe that if I did run for President, I'd win."[368] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired man in America.[369][370]
2000 presidential campaign
Main article: Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign
In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the nomination of the Reform Party for the 2000 presidential election.[371][372] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[373] Trump eventually dropped out of the race, but still went on to win the Reform Party primaries in California and Michigan.[372][374] After his run, Trump left the party due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[371] Trump also considered running for president in 2004.[375] In 2005, Trump said that he voted for George W. Bush.[376] In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president.[377]


Trump speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2011
2012 presidential speculation
Trump publicly speculated about running for president in the 2012 election, and made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. The speech is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[378] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election.[379] In February 2012, Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for president.[380]
Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[381] Trump's moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[379][382][383] Before the 2016 election, The New York Times speculated that Trump "accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world" after Obama lampooned him at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April 2011.[384]
2013–2015
In 2013, Trump was a featured CPAC speaker.[385] In a sparsely-attended speech, he railed against illegal immigration while seeming to encourage immigration from Europe, bemoaned Obama's "unprecedented media protection", advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and suggested that the government "take" Iraq's oil and use the proceeds to pay a million dollars each to families of dead soldiers.[386][387] He spent over $1 million that year to research a possible 2016 candidacy.[388]
In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. Trump responded that while New York had problems and its taxes were too high, he was not interested in the governorship.[389] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[390] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[391]
2016 presidential campaign
Republican primaries
Main article: 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries


Trump campaigning in Laconia, New Hampshire, July 2015
On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump discussed illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan: "Make America Great Again".[316][315] Trump said his wealth would make him immune to pressure from campaign donors.[392] He declared that he was funding his own campaign,[393] but according to The Atlantic, "Trump's claims of self-funding have always been dubious at best and actively misleading at worst."[394]
In the primaries, Trump was one of seventeen candidates vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[395] Trump's campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[396]
On Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote, and he remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump was poised to win the Republican nomination.[397] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016—which prompted the remaining candidates Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns—RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[398]
General election campaign
Main article: Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign
After becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016.
Clinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[399][400][401]


Candidate Trump and running mate Mike Pence at the Republican National Convention, July 2016
On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[402] Four days later on July 19, Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[403] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[404][405]
Two days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech. The historically long speech received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[406][407][408]
On September 26, 2016, Trump and Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, and moderated by NBC News anchor Lester Holt.[409] The TV broadcast was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[410] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning of that debate was dominated by references to a recently leaked tape of Trump making sexually explicit comments, which Trump countered by referring to alleged sexual misconduct on the part of Bill Clinton. Prior to the debate, Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular attention, with some saying it undermined democracy.[411][412]
Political positions
Main article: Political positions of Donald Trump
Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.–Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Planand the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries[413] to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. During the campaign Trump repeatedly called NATO "obsolete".[414]
His political positions have been described as populist,[415][416][417] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[418] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[419] usually considered a Democratic Party policy.[420][421] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a "fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[422][423]
Trump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[424][425][426] Politico has described his positions as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory",[426] while NBC News counted "141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues" during his campaign.[427]
Campaign rhetoric
In his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[340][428][429] In part due to his fame, and due to his willingness to say things other candidates would not, and because a candidate who is gaining ground automatically provides a compelling news story, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[342]
Fact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[430][431][432] At least four major publications—Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times—have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements, with the Los Angeles Times saying that "Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has".[433] NPR said that Trump's campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[434]
Trump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[435] Trump adopted his ghostwriter'sphrase "truthful hyperbole" to describe his public speaking style.[435][297]
Support from white supremacists
According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[436] During his presidential campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white supremacists.[437][438][439] He retweeted open racists,[440][441] and repeatedly refused to condemn David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan or white supremacists, in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, saying that he would first need to "do research" because he knew nothing about Duke or white supremacists.[442][443] Duke himself was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump throughout the 2016 primary and election, and has stated that he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to "take our country back".[444][445]
After repeated questioning by reporters, Trump said that he disavowed David Duke and the KKK.[446][447][448] Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe: "I disavowed him. I disavowed the KKK. Do you want me to do it again for the 12th time? I disavowed him in the past, I disavow him now."[448]
The alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[449] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[450][451][452] Members of the alt-right enthusiastically supported Trump's campaign.[453] In August 2016, he appointed Steve Bannon—the executive chairman of Breitbart News—as his campaign CEO; Bannon described Breitbart News as "the platform for the alt-right."[454] In an interview days after the election, Trump condemned supporters who celebrated his victory with Nazi salutes.[447][455]
Financial disclosures
As a presidential candidate, Trump disclosed details of his companies, assets, and revenue sources to the extent required by the FEC. His 2015 report listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $265 million.[93][456] The 2016 form showed little change.[94]
Trump did not release his tax returns during his presidential campaign or afterward,[457][458] contrary to usual practice by every candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976 and to his promise in 2014 to do so if he ran for office.[459][460][461] Trump's refusal led to speculation that he was hiding something.[462] He said that his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[463][464] Trump has told the press that his tax rate was none of their business, and that he tries to pay "as little tax as possible".[465][466][467]
In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[468]He said that he did use the tax code to avoid paying taxes.[469][470][471]
On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to Rachel Maddow and shown on MSNBC. The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150 million and paid $38 million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of these documents and stated: "Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns."[472][473]
In April 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee made a formal request to the Internal Revenue Service for Trump's personal and business tax returns from 2013 to 2018.[474][475]
Sexual misconduct allegations
Main articles: Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape and Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations
A total of 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct as of December 2017.[476] Trump has denied all of the accusations, which he has called "false smears", and alleged a conspiracy against him.[477][478][479]
Two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[480][481][482] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. In the tape, Trump said: "I just start kissing them ... I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab 'em by the pussy."[483] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he "moved on her very heavily".[483]
Trump's language on the tape was described by the media as "vulgar", "sexist", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[484][485] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[486][487] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[488]Subsequently, at least 15 women[489] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[490][491] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump alleged that former president Bill Clinton had "abused women" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.[492]
Election to the presidency
Main article: 2016 United States presidential election


2016 electoral vote results
On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides.[493] Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[494][d] Clinton was ahead nationwide by 2.1 percentage points, with 65,853,514 votes (48.18%) to 62,984,828 votes (46.09%); neither candidate reached a majority.[497]
Trump's victory was considered a stunning political upset by most observers, as polls had consistently showed Hillary Clinton with a nationwide—though diminishing—lead, as well as a favorable advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated throughout his campaign,[498] and many observers blamed errors in polls, partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[499] The polls were relatively accurate,[500] but media outlets and pundits alike showed overconfidence in a Clinton victory despite a large number of undecided voters and a favorable concentration of Trump's core constituencies in competitive states.[501]
Trump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress.
Trump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history, even after adjusting for inflation.[502] He is also the first president without prior government or military service.[503][504][505] Of the 43[e] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office, two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet, and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[505]
Protests
Main article: Protests against Donald Trump


Women's March in Washington on January 21, 2017, a day after the inauguration
Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice versa both inside and outside the venues.[507][508][509] Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States, in opposition to his policies and his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that these were "professional protesters, incited by the media", and were "unfair", but he later tweeted, "Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country."[510][511]
In the weeks following Trump's inauguration, massive anti-Trump demonstrations took place, such as the Women Marches, which gathered 2,600,000 people worldwide,[512] including 500,000 in Washington alone.[513] Moreover, marches against his travel ban began across the country on January 29, 2017, just nine days after his inauguration.[514]

Early actions
See also: Presidential transition of Donald Trump and First 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency
Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[515]
On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the Supreme Court previous held by Justice Antonin Scalia until his death in 2016.[516]
Domestic policy
Economy and trade
Main articles: Economic policy of Donald Trump and Trump tariffs
In December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal tax brackets, increased child tax credit, doubled the estate tax threshold to $11.2 million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.[517] The reduction in individual tax rates ends in 2025. While people would generally get a tax cut, those with higher incomes would see the most benefit.[518][519] Households in the lower or middle class would also see a small tax increase after the tax cuts expire. The bill is estimated to increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.[520][521]


Trump speaking to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017
Trump adopted his current views on trade issues in the 1980s.[522] Trump has been described as a protectionist[523][524][525] because he criticized NAFTA,[526][527] cancelled negotiations towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[528] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum,[529][530] and proposed to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[531][532] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[533][534]
In March 2018, Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries.[535] In response, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting $3.4 billion in U.S. exports.[536][537]
In July, the United States and China imposed tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods,[538][539] expanded to $50 billion in August.[540]
In September the U.S. introduced a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, poised to increase to 25% by the end of the year, and threatened further tariffs on an additional $267 billion if China retaliates.[541] China countered the move with a 10% tariff on $60 billion of U.S. imports,[542] which, combined with the previous round of tariffs, covers almost all $110 billion of U.S. imports to China.[541] According to some analysts, the escalating trade war with China[543] could impact $2 trillion in global trade.[544][545]
Energy and climate
Main article: Environmental policy under the Trump administration
While campaigning, Trump's energy policy advocated domestic support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[546] However, following his election his "America First Energy Plan" did not mention renewable energy and instead focused on fossil fuels.[547] Environmentalists expressed concerns after he announced plans to make large budget cuts to programs that research renewable energy and to roll back Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change and limiting environmental pollution.[548]
Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change[549][550] and his first Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, does not believe that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming. While acknowledging the climate is warming, Pruitt claimed this warming is not necessarily harmful and could be beneficial.[551] Based on numerous studies, climate experts disagree with his position.[552] On June 1, 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[553][554][555]
Government size and deregulation
Trump's early policies have favored rollback and dismantling of government regulations. He signed a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution, the first in 16 years and second overall.[556]During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended or reversed ninety federal regulations.[557][558]
On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, except for those working in certain areas.[559][560] Unlike some past freezes, it barred agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[561] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[561] The hiring freeze was lifted in April 2017.[562]
A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[563][564] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[565]
Health care
In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live: "I believe in universal healthcare."[566] Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[567] and he has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[566][568][569]
During his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or "Obamacare").[570][571] Shortly after taking office, he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May of that year, the House of Representatives voted to repeal it.[572] Over the course of several months' effort, however, the Senate was unable to pass any version of a repeal bill.[573] Trump has expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[574][575][576] The tax reform Trump signed into law at the end of his first year in office effectively repealed the individual health insurance mandate that was a major element of the Obamacare health insurance system; this repeal is scheduled to be implemented in 2019.[577][578][579]
Social issues
Main article: Social policy of Donald Trump
Trump favored modifying the 2016 Republican platform opposing abortion, to allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[580] He has said that he is committed to appointing pro-life justices.[581] He says he personally supports "traditional marriage"[582] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a "settled" issue.[581]Despite the statement by Trump and the White House saying they would keep in place a 2014 executive order from the Obama administration which created federal workplace protections for LGBT people,[583] in March 2017, the Trump administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections for LGBT people.[584]
Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[585][586] although his views have shifted over time.[587] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[588] He favors capital punishment,[589][590] as well as the use of waterboarding and "a hell of a lot worse" methods.[591][592]
Immigration
Main article: Immigration policy of Donald Trump


Trump conferring with Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, January 25, 2017
Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[593] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[594] and criticized birthright citizenship for creating "anchor babies".[595] He said that deportation would focus on criminals, visa overstays, and security threats.[596]
Travel ban
Further information: Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780
Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[597][598][599] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a "proven history of terrorism".[600][601][602]
On January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[603]Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports.[604][605] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[606][607]
On January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order, which she deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional;[608] Trump immediately dismissed her.[609][610] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[611][612] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, and removed priorities for Christian minorities.[613][603] Again federal judges in three states blocked its implementation.[614] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States."[615]
The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, and certain Venezuelan officials.[616] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions with injunctions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4.[617] In January 2018, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the travel ban.[618] The Court heard oral arguments on April 25,[619][618] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June ruling.[620]
DACA
While running for president, Trump said that he intended to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) on "day one" of his presidency. The program, introduced in 2012, allowed people who had either entered or remained in the United States illegally as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and be eligible for a work permit.[621]
In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DACA program would be repealed after six months.[622] Trump argued that "top legal experts" believed that DACA was unconstitutional, and called on Congress to use the six-month delay to pass legislation solving the "Dreamers" issue permanently.[623] As of March 2018, when the delay expired, no legislation had been agreed on DACA.[624] Several states immediately challenged the DACA rescission in court.[625] Two injunctions in January and February 2018 allowed renewals of applications and stopped the rolling back of DACA, and in April 2018 a federal judge ordered the acceptance of new applications; this would go into effect after 90 days.[626]
Family separation at border
Main article: Trump administration family separation policy
In April 2018, Trump enacted a "zero tolerance" immigration policy that took adults irregularly entering the U.S. into custody for criminal prosecution and forcibly separated children from parents, eliminating the policy of previous administrations that made exceptions for families with children.[627][628] By mid-June, more than 2,300 children had been placed in shelters, including "tender age" shelters for babies and toddlers,[629] culminating in demands from Democrats, Republicans, Trump allies, and religious groups that the policy be rescinded.[630] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law.[631][632][633] On June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end family separations at the U.S. border.[634] On June 26 a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Trump administration to stop detaining immigrants parents separately from their minor children, and to reunite family groups that had been separated at the border.[635]
2018–2019 federal government shutdown
Main article: United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019
On December 22, 2018, the federal government was partially shut down after Trump declared that any funding extension must include $5.6 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall to partly fulfill his campaign promise.[636] The shutdown was caused by a lapse in funding for nine federal departments, affecting about one-fourth of federal government activities.[637] Trump said he would not accept any bill that does not include funding for the wall, and Democrats, who control the House, said they would not support any bill that does. Senate Republicans have said they will not advance any legislation that Trump would not sign.[638] In earlier negotiations with Democratic leaders, Trump commented that he would be "proud to shut down the government for border security".[639][640][641]
On January 25, 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a 3-week appropriation bill to fund the government while negotiations on border security funding take place.[642] This ended the 31-day shutdown, the longest such shutdown in U.S. history.[643] On February 14 both houses of Congress passed, and on February 15 Trump signed, a bill to fund the government until September 30, the balance of the fiscal year. At the same time he signed a declaration that there is a national emergency at the country's southern border, ordering that funds from drug interdiction programs and military construction projects be used to build barriers along the border.[644] On March 5, 2019, it was admitted by a senior republican member of Senate that Trump's declaration of emergency would be rejected by the Senate.[645]

Trump has been described as a non-interventionist[646][647] and as an American nationalist.[648] He has repeatedly stated that he supports an "America First" foreign policy.[649] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[648] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[650] He says America should look inward, stop "nation building", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[647] Trump has praised China's president Xi Jinping,[651] Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte,[652] Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,[653] Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,[654] King Salman of Saudi Arabia,[655] Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte[656] and Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro.[657] Trump also praised Poland under the EU-skeptic, anti-immigrant Law and Justice party (PiS) as a defender of Western civilization.[658][659]
ISIS and foreign wars
In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), in 2015 Trump called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[660] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region, a position he later retracted.[661][662]
In April 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[663] According to investigative journalist Bob Woodward, Trump had ordered his Defense Secretary James Mattis to assassinate Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after the chemical attack, but Mattis declined; Trump denied doing so.[664] In April 2018, he announced missile strikes against Assad's regime, following a suspected chemical attack near Damascus.[665]
In December 2018, Trump declared "we have won against ISIS," and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria, contradicting Department of Defense assessments.[666][667][668] Mattis resigned the next day over disagreements in foreign policy, calling this decision an abandonment of Kurd allies that had played a key role in fighting ISIS.[669] One week after his announcement, Trump asserted he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[670] On January 6, 2019, national security advisor John Bolton announced America would remain in Syria until ISIS is eradicated and Turkey guaranteed it would not strike America's Kurdish allies.[671]
Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.[672][673][674] Trump also praised his relationship with Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.[672]
U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 to 14,000, as of January 2017.[675] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[676] U.S. officials said then that they aimed to "force the Taliban to negotiate a political settlement"; in January 2018, however, Trump spoke against talks with the Taliban.[677]

Trump has described the regime in Iran as "the rogue regime".[678] He has repeatedly criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or "Iran nuclear deal") that was negotiated with the United States, Iran, and five other world powers in 2015, calling it "terrible" and saying that the Obama administration negotiated the agreement "from desperation."[679][680] At one point Trump said that despite opposing the content of the deal, he would attempt to enforce it rather than abrogate it.[681]


Protest against Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, Tehran, December 11, 2017
Following Iran's ballistic missile tests on January 29, 2017, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities in February 2017.[682][683][684] Trump reportedly lobbied "dozens" of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May 2017 Brussels summit; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, under which the U.S. may not pursue "any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran." The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement.[685] On May 18, 2018, Trump announced the United States' unilateral departure from the JCPOA.[680]
